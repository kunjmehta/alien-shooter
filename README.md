<h5>The good ol' <strong>Space Invaders</strong> game developed using Pygame</h5>

</div>

-----------------------------------------
### Inspiration

* On my journey of seeing what the hype about Python is all about and learning it, I came across a book 'Python Crash Course' and this game is inspired from the boilerplate project given in the book. 

* A few tweaks and a few additions to the original version in the book resulted in this game. The most noticeable addition is instead of only one mode, there are 3.

------------------------------------------
### Requirements

- Python 3.7+ needs to be installed.
Get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/)
- Pygame needs to be installed. Execute this command in CLI: `python -m pip install pygame`


***


### Modes

- **Arcade**: With three lives, pass as many levels as you can with the highest score possible.
- **Timed**: Try to kill as many aliens as you can in 2 minutes!
- **Survival**: The toughest of them all! You have only one life to kill those aliens.


***


### Controls

- `LARROW`: Move ship left.
- `RARROW` : Move ship right.
- `SPACEBAR`: Shoot.
- `Q`: Quit the game.

**Gamers' Note**: You can only have a certain number of bullets onscreen at a time.

### Installation 

Alas, no Python library in my knowledge supports executable file generation for Python 3.7 yet. Let me know if you find one! :)
- Clone or download the repository onto your local system.
- To play the game, run `alien_shooter.py` via the CLI or any Python IDE. Enjoy!
